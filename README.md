# Solar_Panel_Cleaning_and_Tracking_Mechanism
The Solar Panel Cleaning and Tracking Mechanism project is designed to enhance the efficiency of solar energy systems by automating two critical functions: panel cleaning and sun tracking. Dust accumulation and fixed panel orientation are major factors that reduce solar panel output by up to 30%, especially in dusty environments like India. To address this, the system uses Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs) to detect sunlight intensity and adjust the panelâ€™s position in real-time using DC motors, ensuring optimal alignment with the sun throughout the day. Additionally, a Real-Time Clock (RTC) controls a water pump and wiper mechanism to automatically clean the panel surface at scheduled intervals, eliminating the need for manual cleaning. The entire system is controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller, which also stores the generated energy in a 12V lead-acid battery for continuous power supply during nighttime or cloudy weather. This project offers a cost-effective, low-maintenance solution for improving solar panel performance and reliability, with future scope for IoT integration, dual-axis tracking, and smart weather-based automation. It is suitable for applications in residential setups, commercial solar farms, rural electrification, and smart city infrastructure.
