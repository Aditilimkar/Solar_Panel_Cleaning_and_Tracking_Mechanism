# Solar_Panel_Cleaning_and_Tracking_Mechanism
This project enhances solar panel efficiency using an automated cleaning system and sun-tracking via LDRs and RTC, controlled by ESP32. It ensures optimal sunlight exposure and regular cleaning, storing energy in a battery. Ideal for smart, low-maintenance solar setups in homes and solar farms.
